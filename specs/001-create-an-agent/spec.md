# Feature Specification: Agent Discovery System

**Feature Branch**: `001-create-an-agent`
**Created**: 2025-09-15
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Create an Agent Discovery System for the Agno template project that automatically discovers and registers AI agents without manual configuration."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement must be testable
   � Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   � If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   � If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer using the Agno template project, I need the ability to create new AI agents by simply placing files in a designated folder, without having to manually register them with the system. The system should automatically discover these agents at startup and make them available for use.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a developer has created a new agent file in the designated folder with proper agent definition, **When** the application starts up, **Then** the agent is automatically discovered and registered with AgentOS
2. **Given** a developer uses the @register_agent decorator on a function, **When** the application starts up, **Then** the function is automatically invoked to create and register the agent
3. **Given** a developer creates an agent file following naming conventions, **When** the system performs discovery, **Then** the agent is detected and registered without requiring decorators
4. **Given** an operations team member wants to disable a specific agent in production, **When** they modify the agent's metadata or configuration, **Then** the agent is excluded from registration without code changes
5. **Given** a developer wants to filter agents by tags during development, **When** they specify tag criteria, **Then** only agents matching those tags are loaded and registered
6. **Given** the application is running in development mode with hot reload, **When** a developer adds a new agent file, **Then** the agent becomes available without requiring a full restart

### Edge Cases
- What happens when an agent file has syntax errors or invalid definitions?
- How does the system handle duplicate agent names or conflicting registrations?
- What occurs when an agent's dependencies are missing or unavailable?
- How does the system behave when agent files are removed during runtime?
- What happens when agent metadata is malformed or incomplete?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST automatically scan designated folders for agent definition files at startup
- **FR-002**: System MUST support three discovery patterns with specific priority order: decorator-based (highest priority), convention-based (files ending with _agent.py), then configuration-based (AGENT_CONFIG exports)
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide a fluent builder API for programmatic agent creation with method chaining support
- **FR-004**: Builder API MUST support method chaining for all common agent configurations including models, tools, databases, memory, instructions, and knowledge bases
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow filtering of agents by tags, status, or custom criteria during discovery
- **FR-006**: System MUST support dynamic enabling/disabling of agents at runtime without code changes
- **FR-007**: System MUST maintain metadata for each agent including tags, priority, enabled state, and arbitrary key-value pairs
- **FR-008**: System MUST implement lazy loading to defer agent initialization until needed
- **FR-009**: System MUST validate agent definitions before registration to ensure they meet minimum requirements
- **FR-010**: System MUST be compatible with hot reload functionality for development environments
- **FR-011**: System MUST work with zero configuration for basic usage scenarios
- **FR-012**: System MUST maintain backward compatibility with existing agent definitions during migration to new patterns
- **FR-013**: System MUST integrate seamlessly with existing AgentOS without breaking existing functionality
- **FR-014**: System MUST handle agent discovery failures gracefully without preventing application startup
- **FR-015**: System MUST support agent categorization through metadata for organizational purposes
- **FR-016**: System MUST allow agents to declare dependencies and handle dependency resolution
- **FR-017**: System MUST log which agents are discovered and from which discovery pattern for debugging purposes
- **FR-018**: System MUST provide detailed logging and feedback about the discovery process including errors and warnings

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Agent Definition**: Represents the specification of an AI agent including its capabilities, configuration, and metadata
- **Agent Registry**: Maintains the collection of discovered and registered agents with their current status and discovery source
- **Discovery Pattern**: Defines the method used to identify agent definitions with priority order (decorator > convention-based > configuration-based)
- **Agent Metadata**: Contains descriptive information about agents including tags, priority, enabled state, dependencies, and arbitrary key-value pairs for extensibility
- **Discovery Filter**: Criteria used to select which agents should be loaded based on tags, status, or custom conditions
- **Agent Builder**: Fluent API interface that supports method chaining for configuring agent properties including models, tools, databases, memory, instructions, and knowledge bases
